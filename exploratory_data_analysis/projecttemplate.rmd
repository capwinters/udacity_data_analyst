```



Data used in this EDA is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gimunu/football-striker-performance)



# Univariate Plots Section

A first look at the data shows that we have 13 columns and 7062 observations. 
Some of these columns are numeric, some are categorical. A good example for 
this project. Let's start exploring European Footballs Strikers!

### Some summary information

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
str(data)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, summary}
summary(data)
```

### Distribution of nr. of goals scored by players

Since goal is the ultimate "goal" of the game :), lets take a look at the 
histograms.

```{r echo=FALSE, goals}
# binwidth = 1 because range is up to 60 and it is informative to be able 
# to count goals 1 by 1

ggplot(aes(x = goals), data = subset(data, !is.na(goals))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) 

```
```{r echo=FALSE, goals_summary}
summary(data$goals)
```

There are 2 interesting points here: 

1. it is likely that most of the strikers do not score a goal, hence we have 
peaks at 0 goals

2. Goals scored has a right skewed charactheristics

### Distribution of nr. of assists made by players 

```{r echo=FALSE, assists}
#binwidth = 1 because range is up to 60 and it is informative to be able to 
# count goals 1 by 1

ggplot(aes(x = assists), data = subset(data, !is.na(assists))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) 

```
```{r echo=FALSE, assists_summary}

summary(data$assists)

```

Distribution of assists are similar to goals, and the reasoning behind is more 
or less the same. However let's keep in mind that generally number of assists 
is 1/2 wrt goals. This is an expected result as assists mostly come from 
midfielders not strikers. 

### Distirbution of minutes played

```{r echo=FALSE, minutes}
#binwidth = 90 because we have high range and 90 is the duration of a game, 
# so that we can also see average game #

ggplot(aes(x = minutes), data = subset(data, !is.na(minutes))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 90) 

```

```{r echo=FALSE, min_summary}

summary(data$minutes)

```

Note that there is a peak close to 0 minutes. This may be due to several 
factors. Substitution, injuries, imperfection in data collection etc.

### Distribution of nr. of games played by players

```{r echo=FALSE, games}

ggplot(aes(x = games), data = subset(data, !is.na(games))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) 

```

Distribution of games played is similar to the minutes, but the peak is a bit 
to the right. This is because of the obviouds correlation btw minutes and games 
played and the fact that whether a player plays 90 mins or 1 mins, games played 
is incremented.

### Structure of data from seasons

```{r echo=FALSE, season_data}

ggplot(data=subset(data, !is.na(games)), aes(x=season)) +
    geom_bar(stat="count")

```

Obviously there is more data after the season 2013-14. This suggests that we 
should look at the frequencies of games played, so that we can normalise the 
effect coming from more data as the seasons come close to present day. 

***Review note*: *** Note that total number of samples per each season is not 
equal. To be able to compare the histograms I divide samples by total samples. 
So that area under each curve is 1 and every X,Y value is comparable. 

```{r echo=FALSE, games_freq}

# put the data in a new dataset and combine the plots. we also normalise the 
# y values so that we can talk about comparable distribuions of are 1 rather 
# than histohrams.

games.freq <- ggplot(aes(x = games, y = ..count../sum(..count..)),
       data = subset(data, !is.na(games) & season != '2017-18')) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(color = season), binwidth=5, size=1)

min.freq <- ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = ..count../sum(..count..)),
       data = subset(data, !is.na(minutes) & season != '2017-18')) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(color = season), binwidth=500, size=1)

grid.arrange(games.freq, min.freq)

```

Note that, for seasons 2012-13 and 2013-14 number of zero minutes and games is 
relatively high. We must keep this in mind while investigating a feature over 
seasons.

### Age and preferred foot 

Below I provide some more univariate information just to keep in mind on the 
following parts.

```{r echo=FALSE, age}

ggplot(data=subset(data, !is.na(age)), aes(x=age)) +
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, age_summary}

summary(data$age)
               
```

Age histogram of players are as expected. They can become professional at the 
age of 16 and tend to retire after they are 30 years old. 

```{r echo=FALSE, foot}

ggplot(data=subset(data, !is.na(foot) & foot != ''), aes(x=foot, y = ..count../sum(..count..))) +
    geom_bar(stat="count")
               
```

%70 of the player in data are right footed, %20 is left and %10 can use both 
feet. 

### Computed variables

I beleive following variables are interesting to look at:

1. Goals/minute 
2. Goals/game
3. Minutes/Game

Lets add them to the dataset and plot histograms.

```{r echo=FALSE, computed}

# add computed columns to datasets

data$goalsperminute <- with(data, goals/minutes)
data$goalspergame <- with(data, goals/games)
data$minutespergame <- with(data, minutes/games)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, goalspermin}

# filtering 0 values as they are not useful for such a variable

ggplot(data=subset(data, !is.na(goalsperminute) & goalsperminute !=0), 
       aes(x=goalsperminute)) +
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.0005)

```
```{r echo=FALSE, goalspermin_summary}

summary(data$goalsperminute)

```

Note that we filter goalsperminute = 0 cases, as this histogram is more relevant
"if" goal is scored and a peak at 0 makes it hard to see actual charactheristics 
when one or more goal is scored.

```{r echo=FALSE, goalspergame}

ggplot(data=subset(data, !is.na(goalspergame) & goalspergame !=0 ), 
       aes(x=goalspergame)) +
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)

```
```{r echo=FALSE, goalspergame_summary}
summary(data$goalspergame)
```

Note again that we filter no goal cases. It is also important to note that 
max(goalpergame) = 2.0 does not mean that a player cannot score more than 2 
goals per game. It is the ratio that players can reach given the goals they 
scored and the games thay played that season.

```{r echo=FALSE, minutespergame}

ggplot(data=subset(data, !is.na(minutespergame)), aes(x=minutespergame)) +
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)

```
```{r echo=FALSE, minutespergame_summary}

summary(data$minutespergame)

```

This histogram is again as expected. It is obvious that a football game is 90 
minutes and 120 minute is not an outlier. It is due to the fact that some games 
can go to extra time. In fact we are looking at the leagues, not tournamets and 
this should not normally occur, but I will keep this as it is, because there may 
be a playy-off case or a similar game that takes 120 mins. Since it is very rare 
it will not be very critical in ou conclusions. 

# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?

Data includes 7062 observations with 13 variables. 7 of these are factor 
variables. I added 3 computed variables from other columns. 

Factor variables: 

 * current.club  : 193 levels
 * current.league: 10 levels 
 * foot          : 3 levels "both","left", "right
 * name          : 1173 levels
 * nationality   : 285 levels 
 * position      : 2 levels "CF","W" 
 * season        : 6 levels "2012-13","2013-14"..."2017-18"
 
 Other observations:
 
 * there was no need to ordered factors except for seasons. (alphabetical 
 ordering was sufficient for all practical purposes)
 
 * 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons include a little bit more 0 minutes and games per
 player. This may be due to data collection method and/or because the player 
 get more experienced and become more regular starters, hence take more 
 minutes/play in more games.

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

The number of goals a player scores. 

I would like to investigate if the time a player takes leads to higher goals. 
Is there a correlation btw assists and goals a player makes. How the goal 
performance of players is affected from other possible factors like league, 
position etc.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your \
investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

I expect that to be related to the time a player takes on the pitch and maybe 
position and in which league he plays. It is also interesting to see the affect 
of age. It is possible that more experienced players reach higher goal rates. 

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

I created the following variables and added them to the dataframe:

1. Goals/minute 
2. Goals/game
3. Minutes/Game

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? \
Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form \
of the data? If so, why did you do this?

The original data was wide, as the goals/assists/minutes/games were given as 
seperate columns for each season. I did a union like (of SQL) operation to 
append these and added a year column to make it easier to plot histograms 
across all seasons. 

It was also not logical to look at goals/minute and goals/game when there is no 
goal scored. This was leading to very high peaks at 0 on histograms and making 
it hard to observe the distirbution characteristics of these varibles. So, 
while plotting the histograms of calculated variables I filtered the case where 
there is no goal. 

I also observed that amount of NaNs in calculated columns increased as it is 
possible to have 0 minutes/games and this was leading to NaN. My histogram code 
is already filering this by "!is.na(my_variable)" so it was OK as it is. 

# Bivariate Plots Section

Below is a scatter matrix via ggpairs() function to give us a general look.

***Review Note:*** I agree that values are mixed here, but merely a corelation 
plot would not be sufficent here, because it helped me to see box plots of 
categorical variables like position.I am using this plot as a very rough
start point. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}

ggpairs(data, columns=c("goals", "assists", "minutes", "games", "age", 
                        "position", "goalspergame", "goalsperminute"),
        lower=list(combo=wrap("facethist", binwidth=1)))

```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, goals_vs_minutes}

# simple scatter and 2 curve fits of different methods

ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = goals), data = data) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.1) + 
  geom_smooth(method="auto")+
   geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red")+
   geom_vline(xintercept=3250)


```

As expected, as the time that a player takes on pitch increases, total goals he 
scored increases. 

Note also that, relationship is more of exponential especially after 3250 
minutes (blue) on the pitch. Although variance increases at this region, 
this non-linear increase is not a coincidence. This is because more skilled 
players play almost every game. That is, they get more game time and they are 
better at scoring. These are the affects that create exponential relationship 
as we go beyond 3000 minutes. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, goals_vs_games}

ggplot(aes(x = games, y = goals), data = data) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.1) + 
   geom_vline(xintercept=10, color="red")

```

This plot is also interesting. Note that, there is almost a horizonral line 
until 10 games. So it can be observed that, if a player plays in more than 10 
games in a season, his goal scoring performance will be better (very roughly 
linearly proportional to the nr of games he plays). This may be due to the fact 
that, players who play less than 10 games per season are usually substitutes 
and/or less talented players. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, goals_vs_age}

# adding a mean line to see how the average changes wrt age

ggplot(aes(x=age, y = goals), data = subset(data, !is.na(goals) & goals !=0)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.1) + geom_line(stat='summary', fun.y=mean, color="red")
                                    

```

Here we observed that as the player get more experienced total goals per season 
increases, but data becomes more noisy for ages < 20 and > 30 due to the 
decrease of samples. i.e. less footballers of these ages. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, age_vs_minutes}

ggplot(aes(x = age, y = games), data = data) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.1) 

```

This suggests that, there is not much relation between the age of a player and 
the minutes he play per season. I would expect a little bit more correlation 
here, which was interesting to see that there is not. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, position_goals_box}

ggplot(data, aes(x = position, y = goals)) +
        geom_boxplot()

```

This suggests that central forwars (CF) can on avarge score more goals per 
season wrt wingers. This is again an expected result. What about the assists 
they make? 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, position_assits_box}

ggplot(data, aes(x = position, y = assists)) +
        geom_boxplot()

```

And here it is. Wingers tend to make more assists compated to center forwards. 
This is again expected as they play on sides of the pitch and usually cross in 
appropriate situations so that CFs can score. CFs however tend to directly 
search for goal and unless the team is playing with 2 forwards their assist 
options will be less. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, league_goals}

ggplot(data, aes(x = current.league, y = goals)) +
        geom_boxplot()

```

Now at first sight... there is not much to see here. But if we focus on 
***outliers*** La Liga has higher outliers. If you are a football fan, you may 
have already started to think about Lionel Messi and Chirstiano Ronaldo. 
Let's see who are these la liga guys?


```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, list_goals}

la_liga_top_scorers = subset(data, goals > 50, c("name","goals","season"))
la_liga_top_scorers[order(-la_liga_top_scorers[,"goals"]),]

```

And you were right! Only with the exception of Luis Suarez in season 2015-16 
where he also scored 59 goals. 

### Most efficient Leagues, Players and Clubs

It is also interesting to look at the efficieny of goal scoring. We define 
efficiency by mean value of goals per minute by league/club/player. i.e. how 
many goals per minute a player/club/league scores. 

It is important to point out that I preferred to take only 2017-18 season for 
these computations. This is because, we have the "current team" column due to 
the fact that some players change teams every season. Structure of data is not 
appropriate to group over seasons for such computations. 

Below are some interesting stats.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, league_goalspermin}

# creating a new dataset via grouping over league from latest season only
# 90* is for better intiutive analysis. We can roughly talk about x.x goals 
# per game 

data.by_league <- subset(data, season == '2017-18') %>%
  dplyr::group_by(current.league) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Mean = 90*mean(goalsperminute, na.rm=TRUE),
            n=n()) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-Mean)

data.by_league

```

The most surprising thing here was to see that Turkish Süper League is the place
where the most efficient strikers play! This season, there occurs 0.37 goals for
every 90 minutes of football played in the league. (Note: I multiplied 
goalsperminute*90 so that we can talk about goals per game which is more 
intiutive. But, this should not be confused by our actual "goalspergame"" 
column) 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# creating a new dataset via grouping over league from latest season only
# 90* is for better intiutive analysis. We can roughly talk about x.x goals 
# per game 

data.by_player <- subset(data, season == '2017-18') %>%
  dplyr::group_by(name, current.club) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(goals_per_minute = 90*mean(goalsperminute, na.rm=TRUE),
                   total_minutes = sum(minutes, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-goals_per_minute)
  
# taking only top players cos we have a lot and also a layer must have played 
# at least 900 minutes. 
# ie. effective 10 games at least. 

head(subset(data.by_player, total_minutes > 900))

```

Here it is interesting to see the top 3. (Note: I filtered the results by taking
players who played at least 900 minutes this season. ie. 10 effective game time)

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# creating a new dataset via grouping over league from latest season only
# 90* is for better intiutive analysis. We can roughly talk about x.x goals per 
# game 

data.by_team <- subset(data, season == '2017-18') %>%
  dplyr::group_by(current.club, current.league) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Mean = 90*mean(goalsperminute, na.rm=TRUE),
                   total_minutes = sum(minutes, na.rm = TRUE),
            n=n()) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-Mean)
  
# here we ignore teams with only one striker in the data and teams with strikers
# who played very short time in total (which is not very likely anyways)

head(subset(data.by_team, total_minutes > 1000 & n > 2))

```

Here we see there is not a direct bias from league, club or player in terms of 
effectiveness. Since number of teams, players change in each grouping we see 
different 

# Bivariate Analysis


### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in \
the dataset?

Our primary feature of interest was the total number of goals scored by 
strikers. We observed that there is a roughly linear relationship with minutes 
played per season and goals scored. We also observed that this relationship 
becomes exponential as the minutes exceed 3250 minutes (35 games). This is 
because, players who play more than this much of games are exceptionally good 
players with high consistency. 

Another strong relation that effected the total number of goals scored per 
season was the position. In this data there is ony two positions were given: 
CF, W. I observed that CF has higher mean wrt W.

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features \
(not the main feature(s) of interest)?

Yes. I observed that wingers (W) tend to make more assits per season wrt 
forwards (CF).

I also oberved that the following relationships: 

 * La Liga Strikers Lionell Messi and C. Ronaldo are the reason of the outliers 
 of total goals per season which are higher than other leagues.
 * In terms of goal scoring efficiency (goalsperminute) the top league of season
 2017-18 is ***Serie-A***
 * In terms of goal scoring efficiency (goalsperminute) the top player of season
 2017-18 is ***Bafetimbi Gomis***
 * In terms of goal scoring efficiency (goalsperminute) the top club of season 
 2017-18 is UC ***Sampdoria***

### What was the strongest relationship you found?

The number of goals per season is highly correlated with position and total 
minutes on pitch. 


# Multivariate Plots Section

### Relationship of goals, minutes/games and position

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, Multivariate_Plots}

ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = goals, colour = position), data = data) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2)

```



Note how CFs paint the upper part of the histogram. It is very obvious that 
their goal efficiency is higher. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, Multivariate_Plotsfacet}

ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = goals, colour = position), data = data) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) + facet_wrap(~current.league, ncol=5) 

```

When we break it to leagues, we see more or less same behaviour. No league 
stands out visually.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = goals, colour = position), data = data) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) + facet_wrap(~season, ncol=3) 

```

When we brea it int seasons again nothing stands out visually, except 2017-18 
season. This is normal as it is not finished yet.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, Multivariate_Plots_games}

ggplot(aes(x = games, y = goals, colour = position), data = data) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)

```

The seperaiton of positions is even more clear when we look at games played vs 
goals scored.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(aes(x = games, y = goals, colour = position), data = data) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) + facet_wrap(~current.league, ncol=5) 

```

Breking into leagues does not reveal a lot again. Russian Premier Liga and Greek 
Super League are a bit behind others in terms of maximum golas scored. They 
obivously have less efficient strikers.

### Relationship of assists, minutes/games and position

Now, let's look at the assits the same way we did for goals:

The most important observation is that, assists are less seperated wrt position. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, Multivariate_Plots_assists}

ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = assists, colour = position), data = data) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) 

```
```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(aes(x = games, y = assists, colour = position), data = data) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) 

```
```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(aes(x = games, y = assists, colour = position), data = data) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) + facet_wrap(~current.league, ncol=5)

```

Serie A is a bit different here. I will add more detailed explanation of this 
in reflection part. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(aes(x = games, y = goals, colour = age), data = data) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.2)

```

Age does not seem to be correlated in any visible sense with goals scored. 


# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of \
looking at your feature(s) of interest?

The most interesting strengthening feature was the position. It was clearly 
observed that central forwards (CF) are more involved in goals scored wrt 
wingers (W).

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

Effect of position in assists made was a bit in favor of wingers as expected, 
but the differentiation was not as clear as the effect of position on goals 
scored.

Also it was an iteresting observation to see that in Serie A (Italy) center 
forwards are much less involved in assists wrt other leagues of Europe.

strengths and limitations of your model.

                  color = "blue") +

Leagues \n

      ylab("Count of goals") + xlab("Goals per season") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 61, 2), limits = c(0, 61)) 

```

### Description One

Our main feature of exploration was the amount of goals scored per season. This 
histogram shows the most general charactheristics of strikers' goal performance 
in football game. For European leagues (and I would strongly expect other 
continents be very similar) we found out that a striker scores on avarage 6.7 
goals per season. Considering 3rd quantile is 9 goals, we can assume a striker 
is a decent one if he scores > 9 goals per season. 

### Plot Two
```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# same code with some cosmetic additions

ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = goals), data = data) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.1) + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess")+
   geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red")+
   ggtitle("Total goals scored by a player in a season vs total minutes he 
played \n 
(seasons 2013/14 to 2017/18) ") +
      ylab("Total goals") + xlab("minutes on pitch") + 
        geom_text(data=goal_stats, aes(x=4500, y=10, label="linear_fit"), 
                  size=4, parse=T, color = "red")+
        geom_text(data=goal_stats, aes(x=4000, y=40, label="loess_fit"), 
                  size=4, parse=T, color = "blue") 
 
```

### Description Two

With the information provided in dataset, it turned out that a strong feature 
to affect total goals per season was the total minutes a player stayed on the 
pitch. Above scatter plot shows that until 3000 minutes of game time strikers 
total goals per season is linearlt proportional to the minutes taken. 

However, a better fit reveals another interesting finding beyond 3000 minutes 
(approx. 30 games). Goal scoring performance of players who play more than 30 
games per season is increasing exponentially. As I stated above, this is an 
interesting finging for me, but nonethless explainable. Because, very rare and 
skilled players play that much games per season and not only the minutes they 
take, but also their exceptional skills become more distinguishable. 


### Plot Three
```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = goals, colour = position), data = data) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) + 
   ggtitle("Total goals scored by CF & W positions in a season vs total mins 
played\n 
(seasons 2013/14 to 2017/18) ") +
      ylab("Total goals") + xlab("minutes on pitch") 

```

### Description Three

After the hint given in scatter matrix, it was obvious that position was very 
relevant in the amonut of total goals scored per season. Therefore, it was 
necessary to further investigate the scatter plot of goals per minute wrt 
position. Color coding wrt position revealed even more interesting and 
clarifying results. We saw that center forwards contribute to the upper part of 
the scatter plot with clear difference.

# Reflection

As a football fan and enthusiastic data scientist "candidate", it was very 
entertaining and educative to go through this EDA. While doing my own data set 
search, I encountered this dataset; that was a good choice in terms of structure 
but still needed to be a little bit modified in order to be able to work 
smoothly with R studio. Thanks to previous python (pandas) skills we learned, 
it was easy to shape data to be explored. 

I really did not know what to expect from this data. I was not even sure how 
correct it was collected. The first dissapointing thing was that, Bundesliga 
(German League) was not involved. I guess their statistics are subject to 
copyrigt etc. Second suspicion I still have is the relative high amount of 0 
goals and assists for the oldest seasons. I preferred to either filter these 
values or did use the most recent season depending on the content of analysis. 

Other than that every step was either jaw dropping (at least for me :) )  or a 
mathematical confirmation of the intiutive expectation of an 36 year old 
football fan as myself. Follwing are my highlights:

 * 10 goals per season is really a decent amount and this was what I exactly 
 found out!
 
 * To see Messi and Ronaldo as an outlier in a boxplot was again a confirmation 
 of how exceptional these players are
 
 * It was really really interesting to find out that our good old and not very 
 popular Turkish League was in fact the league where the most efficient stirkers
 played. 
 
 * To find out the afffect of position in multivariate analysis was somewhat 
 expected, but never the less beatiful to see.
 
 * And about the title picture of this EDA. The picture belongs to Bafetimbi 
 Gomis, center forward of Galatasaray who turned out to be the most efficient 
 striker in Europe according to the goals per minute analysis I did. 
 
 * Final highlight was somewhat technical and probably too much detail for a 
 decent footbal fan (an I apologize from the evaluator of this EDA for my 
 tactical passion), but after so many hours of coding and data exploration I 
 have to point out that, it was also interesting to see how Serie A forwards 
 were much behind other leagues in terms of assists. The unique and traditional 
 charactheristics of italian football have long been reluctant to adapt to the 
 modern tactics and this is to be seen not only their absence at the top of 
 European football wrt 90s, but also to the very detail of may facet_wrap wrt 
 current.league scatter diagram. Data speaks for it self and we would not be 
 wrong if we deduce that, in the era of hard working and physically top level 
 central forwards, Italy still has "poachers" whose sole aim is to be at the 
 right place, at the right time.
 
I think to include only wingers and central forward lacks a bit of completeness.
It could be logical to include attacking midfileders too, but then I think it 
would be harder to see such a nice scatter graph when we colored wrt position. 
For future analysis, it may be interesting to look at assists vs goals and 
define a more elaborate metric of a so called " complete" striker whose 
contirbution to his team is event more than just scoring goals.
